Problem Statement 

 As we all know Coronavirus cases are drastically increasing and second wave has arisen in our country. We all are aware of the pathetic covid crisis in our country, daily we are losing our beloved ones with this virus. The affected number of people are in such a large number that our medical system has failed to save our country people. The second wave in the country in terrifying people are dying due to lack of oxygen levels. Our medical system has invented the dose against Covid Virus but to reach people with the dose in the main challenge of our system. Our country India is the second highest country in terms of population. People to get vaccinated is challenging task and to get them in record who has been vaccinated or not, is much more stretching work. To deal with this I decided to build a site in which we can have record the patients who can register for vaccination and this way we can know who got vaccinated and how many people are pending. We can make some of our work easy with the data of the patients stored in the site and with that we can aware people about the vaccination of coronavirus how it will help to fight against Covid. Letâ€™s get vaccinated!
