Output Screenshots 

Home Page 

I developed my Homepage with the help HTML and CSS. In which I have made icon of Indian symbol ‘satyamev jayate’. I have created Navigation Bar which includes HOME, FAQs, INFORMATION and Helpline number. In the right side of navigation bar, I have created search bar with search button. After that I have used the picture which shows our prime minister of India Narendra Modi saying people to stay protected from coronavirus by following the protocols. Avoid close contact with individuals who are wiped out. Keep up in any event three feet distance among yourself and any individual who is hacking or sniffling. Try not to contact your eyes, nose, and mouth. Remain at home when you are wiped out. Cover your hack or wheeze with a tissue, then, at that point discard the tissue securely. Clean and sanitize as often as possible contacted items and surfaces utilizing a normal family cleaning splash or wipe. Wash your hands frequently with cleanser and water for in any event 20 seconds, particularly in the wake of going to the restroom, prior to eating, and in the wake of cleaning out your nose, hacking, or sniffling. In the event that you have a fever, hack and trouble breathing, look for clinical consideration right away. Remember the tourism warning set out by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In the event that cleanser and water are not promptly accessible, utilize a liquor-based hand sanitizer with at any rate 60% liquor. Continuously wash hands with cleanser and water when hands are apparently filthy.

Next, I have used CSS flex box property with which I have created three boxes, first is about the vaccine in which all the information is related to coronavirus vaccine, second box is about the vaccine registration in which I have created the form in which you can filled your information and that information will be stored in the database (XAMPP).  It is important to store your data securely, easily and redundantly otherwise if you lose it from one place it will be gone forever. Third is about the thing you should know after the vaccination taken. You will get full information about what to expect after the vaccination.

Third is the picture which shows us some common ailments that can be expected after vaccine.
Fourth is the video gallery in which I have added two videos which will encourage one to take the vaccinations and about the precautions given by Mr. Akshay Kumar (the actor).
Fifth I have attached the world map from the website ‘ourworldindata.org ‘which shows the full map and tells us the percentage which country has taken how much amount of vaccination.
Sixth I have included the icon of Aarogya Setu to aware the people to download this app for their benefit from which they can know whether they are safe in the current place and till how many radius.
